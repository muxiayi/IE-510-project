# Normalized-data-with-python
doing a kaggle application
first step:try to normalized data which get from kaggle with python as programming language
second step: try different optimization methods including gradient descent, heavy ball methed, coordinate descent and Explored the different convergence behavior in terms of convergence speed, efficiency.
finally, comparing with different behaviors with the same database when using these three kinds of optimization algorithms and make a conclusion with a summary of the best performance algorithm.
