# an example of kaggle application
Tryinng to apply different algorithms to solve real world problems provided by Kaggle
Aiming at finding the most suitable algorithm to provide predictions by applying several methods, namely, gradient descent method, gradient descent with momentum(including heavy ball method and Nesterovâ€™s method), decomposition-type methods(stochastic gradient descent), quasiNewton algorithm(BFGS method) and BB (Barzilai-Borwein) Method (including LBB method and SBB method).

in this example, the database got from: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data

first step:try to normalized data which get from kaggle with python as programming language

second step: try different optimization methods including gradient descent, heavy ball methed, coordinate descent and Explored the different convergence behavior in terms of convergence speed, efficiency.

finally, comparing with different behaviors with the same database when using these three kinds of optimization algorithms and make a conclusion with a summary of the best performance algorithm.
